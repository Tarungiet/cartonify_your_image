CARTOONIFY YOUR IMAGE:
This Python script allows you to transform your images into cartoon-like representations. 
It utilizes various image processing techniques such as edge detection, smoothing, and filtering to achieve the cartoon effect.

PREREQUISITES:
Python 3.x
LIBRARIES:
OpenCV (cv2)
EasyGUI (easygui)
NumPy (numpy)
ImageIO (imageio)
Matplotlib (matplotlib)
tkinter (tkinter)
Pillow (PIL)
Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:
Copy code
#pip install opencv-python easygui numpy imageio matplotlib pillow
Usage
Run the script.
Click on "Cartoonify an Image" to select an image from your filesystem.
The script will process the image and display a series of transformations including grayscale conversion, edge detection, and the final cartoonified image.
Click on "Save cartoon image" to save the cartoonified image to your filesystem.
Instructions
When prompted, select an image file (e.g., JPEG, PNG) from your local storage.
The script will generate a series of images displaying the different stages of the cartoonification process.
Adjustments to the cartoonification process can be made by modifying parameters within the script (e.g., blur radius, edge detection threshold).
The final cartoonified image will be saved with the filename "cartoonified_Image" in the same directory as the original image.
Notes
For best results, choose images with clear outlines and distinct features.
Experiment with different parameter values to achieve desired effects.
